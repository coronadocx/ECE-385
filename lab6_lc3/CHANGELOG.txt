Changelog:
	-States were not attached to the correct opcode in ISDU, corrected them
	-Bus had MAR as input instead of ADDR_OUT. Changed .MAR(MAR) to .MAR(ADDR_OUT)
	-Added SR1 Mux signal to State 1
	-Status CC was defaulting to 1, made sure it wasn't doing that (more for readibility, not a bug really)
	-Added state S_00, i think BR needs it to precess where to go.
		*BR needed S_00
	-BRn needs work
		*BEN unit wasn't checking the sign correctly, manually checking the 16th bit fixes issue
	-BRzp not jumping correctly (PC<-imm5) instead of (PC<-PC+ + imm5)
		*Turns out ADDR1MUX was not set correctly

	-Synchronized Signals
